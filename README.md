# Polynomial_Factorization

# Introduction

This is an experiment where I tried to see how will could a transformer model learn to decompose polynomials with integer coefficients into
their irreducible factors.

# Technical
* Written for Python 3

* Uses keras with TensorFlow 2 and the package keras-transformer. You can install the latter via

```console
pip install keras-transformer
```
